A lifetime of working with nuclear power has left me with a healthy green glowâ€¦and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner. Me fail English? That's unpossible. Get ready, skanks! It's time for the truth train!

I prefer a vehicle that doesn't hurt Mother Earth. It's a go-cart, powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction. Your guilty consciences may make you vote Democratic, but secretly you all yearn for a Republican president to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king!
